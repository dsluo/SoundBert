# SoundBert

A soundboard for [discord](https://discordapp.com/).

This iteration of SoundBert is now archived, due to the [drop in support](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1) of the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library by its author.

I might end up re-writing this bot (again) in Rust or Javascript, but that's on the backlog for now.
